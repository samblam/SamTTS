# System Patterns

## Repository Structure
- Using standard Git workflow
- Following GitHub best practices for repository management
- Documentation maintained in `cline_docs/` directory
- React application located in the `twitch-tts/` directory

## Version Control Patterns
- Main branch will be the primary development branch
- Commit messages will follow conventional commits format
- Git ignore patterns will be set up for common development artifacts

## Documentation Patterns
- README.md will serve as the primary project documentation
- Memory Bank documentation maintained in cline_docs/
- Additional documentation will be added as project scope is defined

## Application Architecture
- Using React framework for UI development
- Component-based architecture for UI components
- State management using React state or Context API (to be determined)
- Modular design for TTS functionality and Twitch integration

Note: This document will be updated with specific architectural and system patterns as they are established during project development.
